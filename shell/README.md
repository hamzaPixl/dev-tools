# Zsh and Bash Profile for macOS Developers

This directory provides ready-to-use configuration files and scripts for setting up a productive terminal environment on macOS, supporting both Zsh (default) and Bash shells. It includes:

- Modern, fast, and minimal prompt themes
- Aliases for common dev tasks (Git, Docker, Node, Python, etc.)
- Functions for project navigation and automation
- Linting helpers and quick-fix commands
- Useful tools: fzf, bat, exa, fd, jq, tldr, and more
- macOS-specific tweaks for Homebrew, networking, and clipboard
- Setup scripts for easy installation

## üìÑ Files & Usage

- `zshrc`: Drop-in `.zshrc` for Zsh users (macOS default)
- `bash_profile`: Drop-in `.bash_profile` for Bash users
- `aliases.sh`: Shared aliases and functions (sourced by both shells)
- `install.sh`: One-step setup for recommended tools and configs
- `README.md`: This guide

### Quick Start

1. Copy `zshrc` or `bash_profile` to your home directory as `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`.
2. Source `aliases.sh` from your shell config (already included in provided files).
3. Run `install.sh` to install recommended CLI tools (Homebrew required).

```sh
cd dev-tools/shell
bash install.sh
```

### Recommended Tools (installed by `install.sh`)

- fzf (fuzzy finder)
- bat (better cat)
- exa (modern ls)
- fd (fast find)
- jq (JSON processor)
- tldr (community man pages)
- git, node, python, docker, gh, etc.

---

## Customization

- Add your own aliases/functions to `aliases.sh`.
- All configs are modular and safe to extend.

## Links

- [Root Dev Tools README](../README.md)
- [Cloud CLI setup and usage](#cloud-provider-cli-access--setup): See below for AWS, Azure, and GCP CLI install and configuration instructions. All tools are installed by `install.sh` and ready for use after setup.
